    "Given a propositional formula $G$ and $A_1, A_2, ... A_n$ the atoms occurring in the formula then the assignment of truth values (***T*** or ***F***) to $A_1, A_2, ... A_n$ is called an _interpretation_.\n",

    "# First Order Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes also referred to as \"predicate logic\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terms, Predicates and Atoms\n",
    "\n",
    "_Terms_ are defined recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A constant is a term.\n",
    "2. A variable is a term.\n",
    "3. If $f$ is an $n$-place function symbol, and $t_1, ..., t_n$ are terms, then $f(t_1, ..., t_n)$ is a term.\n",
    "4. All terms are generated by applying the above rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _predicate_ is a mapping from a list of terms to a truth value.\n",
    "If $P$ is an $n$-place predicate symbol, and $t_1, ..., t_n$ are terms, then $P\\left( t_1, ..., t_n \\right)$ is an _atom_.\n",
    "Using the same five logical connectives to build formulas from atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "First order logic deals with variables. \n",
    "In order to characterize those we use the symbols:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The _universal quantifier_: $\\left( \\forall x \\right)$ \"For all x...\"\n",
    "2. The _existential quantifier_: $\\left( \\exists x \\right)$ \"There exists an x...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "The occurrence of a variable in a formula is called _bound_ if the the occurrence is within the scope of a quantifier employing the variable or the occurrence is the quantifier. Otherwise it is considered _free_.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable in a formula is said to be _free_ if at least one occurrence of it is free in the formula and is _bound_ if at least one occurrence of it is bound.\n",
    "Therefore a variable can both be considered free and bound in a formula. For instance consider $\\left(\\forall x\\right)P\\left(x,y\\right) \\lor \\left(\\exists y\\right)Q\\left(y \\right)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Well formatted formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "_Well formatted formulas_ are defined recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An atom is a formula.\n",
    "2. If $G$ and $H$ are formulas, then so are $\\left(\\neg G \\right)$, $\\left(G \\lor H \\right)$, $\\left(G \\land H \\right)$, $\\left(G \\implies H \\right)$ and $\\left(G \\iff H \\right)$.\n",
    "3. If $G$ is a formula and $x$ is a free variable in $G$, then $\\left(\\forall x \\right)G$ and $\\left(\\exists x \\right)G$ are formulas.\n",
    "4. Formulas are generated only by a _finite number_ of applications of the rules above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "Since first order logic uses variables assign truth values to atoms is not sufficient.\n",
    "The domain and an assignment to constants, predicate and function symbols needs to be specified first. \n",
    "Then we can define an interpretation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "A _interpretation_ of a first order logic formula $F$ consists of a nonempty domain $D$, and an assignment of \"values\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Constants are assigned an element in $D$\n",
    "2. $n$-place function symbols are assigned a mapping from $D^n = \\{\\left(x_1, ..., x_n\\right) | x_1 \\in D, ..., x_n \\in D \\}$ to $D$.\n",
    "3. $n$-place predicate symbols are assigned a mapping from $D^n$ to {***T***, ***F***}.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation for a formula $G$ can be computed by using these rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $\\iff, \\implies, \\land, \\lor, \\neg$ are evaluated as usual.\n",
    "2. $\\left( \\forall x \\right)G$ is ***T*** if $G$ is ***T*** for every $d \\in D$.\n",
    "3. $\\left( \\exists x \\right)H$ is ***T*** if $H$ is ***T*** for at least one $d \\in D$\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulas containing free variables cannot be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validity and Consistency \n",
    "\n",
    "Validity and consistency are defined similar to the definitions in the propositional logic.\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula $G$ is consistent if there exists an interpretation $I$ under which $G$ is assigned the value ***T***. If this is the case we say that $I$ is a _model_ of $G$ and _satisfies_ it.\n",
    "Again: If there is no interpretation that satisfies $G$ then the formula is considered inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, a formula is considered valid if every interpretation of the formula satisfies the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Logical consequence \n",
    "\n",
    "Logical consequence is defined exactly the same as above, meaning that:\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula $G$ _logically follows from_ $F_1, ..., F_n$ if and only if any interpretation $I$ in which $F_1 \\land ... \\land F_n$ is true $G$ is also true.\n",
    "$F_1, ..., F_n$ are called _axioms_ of $G$.\n",
    "Two practical ways of showing logical consequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $F_1, ..., F_n$ and a formula $G$, $G$ is a logical consequence of $F_1, ..., F_n$ if the formula $\\left( F_1, ..., F_n \\right) \\implies G$ is valid or if the formula $F_1 \\land ... \\land F_n \\land \\neg G$ is inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prenex normal form\n",
    "\n",
    "Prenex normal form is used to simplify prove procedures (handy if you consider the topic...).\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula is considered to be in prenex normal form if it is in the form of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left(Q_1 x_1 \\right)...\\left(Q_n x_n\\right)\\left(M\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where in every $\\left(Q_i x_i\\right), i = 1,..., n$ the $Q$ is one of the quantifiers discussed above and $M$ is a formula free of quantifiers.\n",
    "In this case $\\left(Q_1 x_1 \\right)...\\left(Q_n x_n\\right)$ is called the prefix and $M$ the matrix of the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or less formal: All quantifiers are placed at the start of the formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "Equality is the same as discussed before but with some added rules around quantifiers and free variables.\n",
    "Let $F[x]$ denote a formula $F$ with a free variable $x$ in it. Let $G$ be a formula without the variable $x$.\n",
    "It follows:\n",
