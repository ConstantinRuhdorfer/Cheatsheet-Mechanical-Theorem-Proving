    "# Mechanical Theorem Proving\n",
    "\n",
    "This file contains a number of relevant formulas and theorems to remember when working in the field of automatic reasoning/mechanical theorem proving.\n",
    "This is updated while I introduce myself to the field.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some quick basics and notation are discussed here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Propositional Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "A proposition is a declarative sentence that can be either true ***T*** or false ***F***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbols ($G$, $H$, $P$ etc.) used to denote a proposition are called _atoms_.\n",
    "\n",
    "From propositions we can build computed propositions by using logical connectives. They are:\n",
    "* $\\neg$ \"Not\"\n",
    "* $\\land$ \"And\"\n",
    "* $\\lor$ \"Or\"\n",
    "* $\\implies$ \"If .. then\" or \"implies\"\n",
    "* $\\iff$ \"If and only if\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Well formatted formulas\n",
    "\n",
    "_Well formatted formulas_ are defined recursively:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An atom is a formula.\n",
    "2. If $G$ is a formula so is ($\\neg G$).\n",
    "3. If $G$ and $H$ are formulas so are ($G\\land H$), ($G\\lor H$), ($G\\implies H$) and ($G\\iff H$).\n",
    "4. All formulas are generated using above rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Braces can be omitted by assigning decreasing ranks to the propositional connectives\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\iff, \\implies, \\land, \\lor, \\neg\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and requiring that the connective with greater rank always reaches further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a propositional formula $G$ and $A_1, A_2, ... A_n$ the atoms occurring in the formula then the assignment of truth values (***T*** or ***F***) to $A_1, A_2, ... A_n$ is called an _interpretation_.\n",
    "A formula $G$ is said to be _true under an interpretation_ if $G$ is evaluated to ***T*** in the interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Validity and Consistency \n",
    "\n",
    "A formula is said to be _valid_ if and only if it is true under all its interpretations. Otherwise it is said to be _invalid_.\n",
    "A formula is said to be _inconsistent_ (or _unsatisfiable_) if and only if it is false under all its interpretations. Otherwise it is said to be _consistent_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equality\n",
    "\n",
    "Two formulas $G$ and $H$, denoted as $G = H$, are considered equal if the truth values of $G$ and $H$ are the same under every interpretation of $G$ and $H$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal forms\n",
    "\n",
    "A _literal_ is an atom or the negation of an atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conjunctive normal form\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula $F$ is said to be in _conjunctive normal form_ if $F$ has the form $F := F_1 \\land ... \\land F_n, n \\geq 1$ where each of $F_1, ..., F_n$ is a disjunction of literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disjunctive normal form\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula $F$ is said to be in _disjunctive normal form_ if $F$ has the form $F := F_1 \\lor ... \\lor F_n, n \\geq 1$ where each of $F_1, ..., F_n$ is a conjunction of literals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Consequence\n",
    "\n",
    "A formula $G$ _logically follows from_ $F_1, ..., F_n$ if and only if any interpretation $I$ in which $F_1 \\land ... \\land F_n$ is true $G$ is also true.\n",
    "$F_1, ..., F_n$ are called _axioms_ of $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two practical ways of showing logical consequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $F_1, ..., F_n$ and a formula $G$, $G$ is a logical consequence of $F_1, ..., F_n$ if the formula $\\left( F_1, ..., F_n \\right) \\implies G$ is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $F_1, ..., F_n$ and $G$, $G$ is a logical consequence of $F_1, ..., F_n$ if and only if the formula $F_1 \\land ... \\land F_n \\land \\neg G$ is inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More\n",
    "\n",
